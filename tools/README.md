# Generate HLSL Token Types

There are a lot of HLSL keywords. To assist in authoring the _token_types.h_,
_token_types.cpp_, _base_type.h_, and _base_type.cpp_ source files, the HLSL keywords
are listed in the txt files in this folder.

Run **gen_token_type.py** in this folder to generate the source files.

This only needs to be done if the list of keywords changes.
